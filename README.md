# fish
bigFish contains a demonstration of transfer learning using BERT pre-trained model, naive-bayes contains another way to process the same information. Both projects attempt to distinguish between Fraudulent & internal emails. 

bigFish can be attributed to griffinacurtiss and multinomialNaiveBayes to Gouri.
